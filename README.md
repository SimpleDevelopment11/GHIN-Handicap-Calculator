# GHIN Handicap Calculator

## Overview

This project consists of a simple scripting program that implements the USGA's GHIN (Golf Handicap Information Network) system. The system is used for golfers to record their scores and identify how many strokes they should receive in relation to par or in relation to their playing partners based on their skill level. 

Using the same formula as GHIN, this script will calculate an accurate GHIN given a golfer's last 20 scores. 

*Note: this does not take into account PCC (Playing Conditions Calculation). For GHIN, this value attempts to adjust a player's score for when they play in difficult or easier conditions. GHIN does this by using its database of scores.*
